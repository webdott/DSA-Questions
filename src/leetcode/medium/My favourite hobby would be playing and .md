My favourite hobby would be playing and watching Basketball. My love for basketball grew as I was in college and most of my colleagues were interested in Football (soccer) but few people had interests in basketball. So i decided to try it out and it turned out that I preferred it to soccer. My best basketball player is Stephen Curry. I believe he is the greatest shooter God ever created. I support the Golden State warriors because they house my favourite player and I believe they are a beautiful sports organization as they take their slogan to heart (Strength in Numbers). There are a lot of other basketball players I love watching like Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and many more.

I also love listening to music and podcasts, I listen to almost anything that makes me move my body. I truly do not have a favourite genre but the top ones would be Afrobeats and Rap. My current best song is Hide and Seek by Stormzy.

I mostly listen to podcasts surrounding tech in general, programming, gospel and conspiracy theories. My favourite podcast currently is the 'WVFRM' podcast by MKBHD.

Places: The Tinapa Free Zone & Resort in Calabar, New Afrika Shrine in Lagos, Obudu Cattle Ranch in Calabar; Food: Jollof rice, Pounded yam/fufu and Egusi soup, Amala and Ewedu, Isi ewu (Goat meat)

I'm really not a fan of taking pictures. But I was in a very good place at that time; the major reason being that I was amongst my best friends, and a friend that happened to be a photographer took a picture of that moment where I laughed.
